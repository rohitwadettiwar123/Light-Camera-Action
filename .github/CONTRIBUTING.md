## Project Philosophy

### 1. Environment First

The project is env-driven. Before hardcoding a value, ask: *should this be configurable?*

**Good:**
```env
VITE_BIRTHDAY_NAME=Priya
```

**Avoid:**
```ts
const name = "Priya";
```

#### 🛠 Adding a New Environment Variable (Contributor Checklist)
When introducing a new customization option:
1. **`.env.example`**: Add the `VITE_*` variable with clear comments, type annotations, and safe defaults.
2. **`useBirthdayStore.ts`**:
   - Add the property to the `BirthdayConfig` TypeScript interface.
   - Parse the variable using `parseEnvString`, `parseEnvBoolean`, `parseEnvNumber`, or `parseEnvList` with safe fallbacks.
   - Include it in the `config` store object.
3. **Component Consumption**: Consume `useBirthdayStore(state => state.config.<prop>)` in relevant React components.
4. **Unit Testing**: Add test assertions in `src/test/` verifying fallback and hydration.
5. **Documentation**: Document the variable, type, default, and purpose in `obsidian-docs/ENV_GUIDE.md` and `README.md`.

### 2. Build for Everyone

Features should work across all relationship types — partner, friend, sibling, parent, grandparent, and more. Avoid relationship-specific hardcoding. Think in systems, not one-off implementations. For extending relationship templates, see [Template-System-Deep-Dive.md](https://github.com/naborajs/birthday-bloom/blob/main/obsidian-docs/Template-System-Deep-Dive.md).

### 3. Extend Existing Systems

Before creating something new, check if an existing component, template, hook, or env variable can be extended. Prefer extension over duplication.

### 4. Respect the Architecture

The repo uses a three-layer architecture: **data** (Zustand store + env parsing), **design** (CSS variable injection + Tailwind), **execution** (scene state machine). Understand these layers before making architectural changes. Incremental improvements are preferred over large rewrites.

## 🚀 The 10-Minute Contributor Fast-Track

New to the project? Here is how to get your first contribution merged in minutes:

1. **Pick an Issue**: Browse open issues labeled [`good first issue`](https://github.com/naborajs/birthday-bloom/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) or [`help wanted`](https://github.com/naborajs/birthday-bloom/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22).
2. **Auto-Claim**: Comment `/assign` on the issue to be assigned automatically by our bot!
3. **Local Setup**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/naborajs/birthday-bloom.git
   cd birthday-bloom
   npm install
   cp .env.example .env.local
   npm run dev
   ```
4. **Make Your Changes**: Clean component structure, proper typing, and cleanup on unmount.
5. **Verify Locally with One Command**:
   ```bash
   npm run verify
   ```
   *(Executes `typecheck` + `lint` + `vitest` + `build` in one unified pipeline).*
6. **Submit PR**: Open a pull request using our interactive PR template!

## Development Setup

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/naborajs/birthday-bloom.git
cd birthday-bloom

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy env template
cp .env.example .env.local

# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Run verification suite before submitting PR
npm run verify     # runs typecheck + lint + test + build
npm run build      # production build
npm run lint       # check lint
npm test           # run tests
npm run typecheck  # TypeScript validation
```

The dev server runs on `http://localhost:5000` by default.

## Finding Work

- **Good first issues**: [Filter by label](https://github.com/naborajs/birthday-bloom/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
- **Docs improvements**: [docs_improvement template](https://github.com/naborajs/birthday-bloom/issues/new?template=docs_improvement.yml)
- **Feature requests**: [feature_request template](https://github.com/naborajs/birthday-bloom/issues/new?template=feature_request.yml)
- **Bug fixes**: [bug_report template](https://github.com/naborajs/birthday-bloom/issues/new?template=bug_report.yml)

If you want to work on something, comment on the issue first so others know it's claimed. You can comment `/assign` or "can I take this" to trigger the auto-assignment bot.

### 🕒 The 48-Hour Assignment Rule

To keep issues moving quickly and ensure the project remains active:
1. When you are assigned an issue, you have **48 hours** to show activity (e.g., commenting on your progress, or linking a Draft PR).
2. If there is no activity for 48 hours, our bot will ping you to check your status.
3. If another **24 hours** pass (72 hours total) with no response, the bot will automatically **unassign** you.
4. Don't worry! If you were just busy, you can always comment `/assign` again to take it back if no one else has claimed it.

## Making Changes

### Branch Naming

```
feat/add-emoji-trail-system
fix/mobile-fireworks-cleanup
docs/improve-env-guide
refactor/simplify-store-parsing
perf/optimize-particle-render
```

### Coding Standards

See [styleguide.md](../obsidian-docs/styleguide.md) for detailed conventions. Key points:

- Components: PascalCase, one per file
- Hooks: `use` prefix, camelCase
- Env variables: `VITE_UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
- Prefer interfaces over types for object shapes
- Use Tailwind utility classes for styling
- Clean up timeouts, RAF IDs, and event listeners on unmount

### What to Check Before Submitting

1. One-click verification passes: `npm run verify`
2. Application runs locally (`npm run dev`)
3. Production build succeeds (`npm run build`)
4. No TypeScript errors (`npm run typecheck`)
5. Lint passes with 0 errors (`npm run lint`)
6. Existing tests pass (`npm test`)
7. Mobile responsiveness is verified
8. If the change affects UI, test with multiple relationship types
9. Documentation is updated if behavior changes

---

## Commit Guidelines

Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
feat: add template-aware emoji trail system
fix: resolve mobile fireworks cleanup issue
docs: improve family system documentation
refactor: simplify birthday template configuration
perf: optimize particle rendering
chore: update dependencies
```

Keep the first line under 72 characters. Reference issues in the body if applicable.

---

## Pull Request Process

2. **Link the issue** your PR addresses
3. **Describe what changed and why**
4. **Include screenshots** for UI changes
5. **Complete the PR checklist** in the template
6. **Keep PRs focused** — one logical change per PR
7. **Respond to review feedback** promptly

Reviewers will check for:
- Correctness
- Consistency with project conventions
- Accessibility considerations
- Documentation completeness
- No visual regressions

## First-Time Contributors

Welcome! Here's how to get started:

1. **Find a `good first issue`** — these are labeled and scoped for newcomers
2. **Read the [architecture.md](../obsidian-docs/architecture.md)** to understand the codebase
3. **Set up the project** using the [Development Setup](#development-setup) section
4. **Ask questions** — comment on the issue if something is unclear

## Final Note

> *"Build features that scale across templates, relationships, and future versions — not just your own use case."*
