## Security Architecture & Best Practices

Birthday Bloom is a client-side single-page application (SPA). All `VITE_` environment variables and URL query parameters ship to the client browser and are **public by design**.

### Critical Guidelines:
1. **Never Store Secrets**: Do not store database connection strings, private API keys, payment tokens, or backend credentials in `VITE_` variables or URL parameters.
2. **XSS Shielding**: All user-supplied text (names, emotional letters, quiz answers) is rendered through React's native JSX escaping and validated without `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
3. **Automated Vulnerability Scanning**: Repository dependencies are continuously monitored via **GitHub Dependabot** and security advisory databases.

If you discover a security vulnerability that goes beyond these design constraints,
please report it privately:

- **Email**: nishant.ns.business@gmail.com
- **Subject**: "[Birthday Bloom Security] — brief description"

Do **not** report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues,
discussions, or pull requests.

1. **Acknowledgment** within 48 hours
2. An initial assessment within 5 business days
3. Regular updates until resolution

## Responsible Disclosure

We ask that you:

- Give us reasonable time to address the issue before public disclosure
- Do not exploit the vulnerability beyond demonstrating it
- Act in good faith to help keep Birthday Bloom and its users safe

## Scope
