# Frequently Asked Questions


🌐 **Canonical Web Documentation**: [Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)](https://naborajs.me/projects/birthday-bloom/docs/faq)

## General

### What is Birthday Bloom?
A cinematic, env-driven birthday surprise platform built with React, Framer Motion,
and Tailwind CSS. It generates a premium interactive experience that tells a story
— from intro to cake cutting to a heart tree finale — all customizable through
environment variables.

### Who is it for?
- **End users** who want to create a magical birthday surprise for someone special
- **Developers** who want to fork, customize, or contribute to an animation-heavy
  React project
- **Anyone** who wants a polished, open-source celebration microsite

### Is it free?
Yes. Birthday Bloom is MIT-licensed. Free to use, modify, and distribute.

## Customization

### How do I change the birthday person's name?
Set `VITE_BIRTHDAY_NAME` in `.env.local` or your hosting dashboard. No code edits needed.
See the [[ENV_GUIDE|ENV_GUIDE.md]].

### How do I add my own photos?
Set `VITE_PHOTO_1`, `VITE_PHOTO_2`, `VITE_PHOTO_3` (or use `VITE_PHOTOS` for unlimited)
with direct image URLs. See the [Photos section in ENV_GUIDE.md](./ENV_GUIDE.md#photos).

### How do I change the theme/color?
Set `VITE_BIRTHDAY_COLOR` to any hex code (e.g. `#FF1493`), or use dynamic URL query parameters like `?template=romantic&color=ff1493`.

### How do I hide sections I don't want?
Use the `VITE_SHOW_*_SECTION` variables. Set any to `false` to hide that section.
See [Sections in ENV_GUIDE.md](./ENV_GUIDE.md#sections).

### How do I make it accessible for older users?
Set `VITE_REDUCED_MOTION=true`, `VITE_ANIMATION_INTENSITY=low`,
and `VITE_ANIMATION_SPEED=slow`.

### Can I add background music?
Yes. Set `VITE_SOUND_URL` to an MP3 URL. Video sharing platforms and direct MP3 links
both work.

## Setup & Development

### How do I run it locally?
```bash
git clone https://github.com/naborajs/birthday-bloom.git
cd birthday-bloom
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local
npm run dev
```

### What Node version do I need?
Node 18+ and npm 9+.

### The dev server shows a blank screen?
Most likely a missing env variable. Ensure `VITE_BIRTHDAY_NAME` is set in `.env.local`.
Check the browser console for errors.

### How do I build for production?
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Deployment

### How do I deploy to Vercel?
1. Push to GitHub
2. Import into Vercel
3. Add environment variables in Vercel dashboard
4. Deploy

See the [[deployment|Deployment Guide]].

### Environment variables work locally but not on Vercel?
You must add them in the Vercel project dashboard under Settings → Environment Variables.
Redeploy after adding them.

## Contributing

### How do I contribute?
See [[CONTRIBUTING|CONTRIBUTING.md]]. Bug fixes, documentation, UI polish,
accessibility improvements, and feature ideas are all welcome.

### I have an idea but I'm not a developer — can I still help?
Yes! Open a feature request, improve docs, report bugs, or share your experience.
All contributions are valued.

### Can I create a surprise without deploying or installing anything?
Yes! Birthday Bloom supports instant client-side customization via **URL Query Parameters**. Visit [https://birthday-bloom.vercel.app](https://birthday-bloom.vercel.app) with parameters:
`https://birthday-bloom.vercel.app/?name=Sarah&rel=partner&lang=en&color=%23FF1493&sender=Alex`
All personalized cards, letters, and theme colors are generated in real-time.

### Why doesn't background music play immediately when the site loads?
Modern mobile and desktop browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome) block automatic audio playback until the user physically interacts with the page. The initial **Splash Screen** provides a tactile "Tap to Start" button that unlocks the Web Audio `AudioContext`.

### How do I bypass or disable the passcode gatekeeper?
Set `VITE_PASSWORD_REQUIRED=false` in `.env.local` or omit `&code=` in URL query parameters. The application will transition directly from the splash screen into the cinematic intro.

### Can I use this commercially?
Yes, the MIT License permits commercial use. Attribution is appreciated but not required.

## Troubleshooting

### Photos don't load?
Ensure URLs are direct image links (ending in `.jpg`, `.png`, `.webp`) and use HTTPS.
Avoid URLs that require authentication.

### Animations lag on mobile?
Set `VITE_ANIMATION_INTENSITY=low`, `VITE_PARTICLE_COUNT=10`, and
`VITE_REDUCED_MOTION=true`.

### The intro animation stops midway?
This is usually a timer issue. Check for env date formatting errors and ensure
`VITE_BIRTHDAY_DATE` is valid. Restart the dev server after fixing.
